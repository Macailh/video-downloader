    """
    Download a video from YouTube in the specified resolution.

    Parameters:
        url (str): The URL of the YouTube video to download.
        resolution (str): The desired resolution of the video. This should be a string representing the
                          resolution, e.g., '720p', '1080p', '480p', etc.

    Raises:
        VideoUnavailable: If the video is not available for download.
        RegexMatchError: If there is an error in the video URL format.
        Exception: For any other unexpected errors during the download process.

    Note:
        - The downloaded video will be saved in the same directory as this script with the filename
          being the title of the video appended with the '.mp4' extension.
        - If the specified resolution is not available, the video will be downloaded in the best
          available resolution.

    Example:
        To download a video with the URL 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef' in 720p resolution:
        ```
        download_video(url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef', resolution='720p')
        ```

        If the specified resolution is not available, it will automatically download the best
        available resolution:
        ```
        download_video(url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef', resolution='480p')
        ```
